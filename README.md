Hey, there!

I’m Zach, self-taught with a passion for Linux systems, automation, and infrastructure. I manage a personal homelab to explore networking, virtualization, and scripting, and I’m always learning new tools to improve system reliability and security. Currently growing my career in IT support and systems administration with a focus on practical problem-solving and user-focused solutions.
