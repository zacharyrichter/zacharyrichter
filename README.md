Hey, there!

I’m Zach, and I’m passionate about tech for IT Pros and Homelab nerds.

Why am I doing all this? Because I just have a genuine love for IT and sharing my knowledge with others. I believe that by presenting what I've learned, I can inspire people to explore and experiment with technology themselves.
